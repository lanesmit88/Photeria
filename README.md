<!-- Overview -->
## Overview

Everybody needs a good laugh from time to time. That's where GoodLaughs can help.

Here's why:
* GoodLaughs is a way for users to share, create, and review laughs
* A laugh can be as simple as a knock-knock joke or a long and humorous story
* Users can save their laughs forever with a LaughBox - create your own and put laughs into it so you'll never forget where a specific laugh is

In the future, we want our users to be able to use GoodLaughs as a social media platform. The ability to search laughs, have a custom profile, and add friends are all features we would have liked to implement.

### Technologies Used

<!-- Features -->
## Features

Below are two key features to our app that we feel are worth sharing about here.

### Trending

The trending page displays all posts on photeria sorted by the number of likes on each post in descending order. This feature allows users the opertunity to discover other users that have made popular posts on the app.

### Creating-Posts

The create post feature allows a user to mkae a post that contains both text and an image. We implemented image uploading useing a base64 approach where we convert the image data into a string and store it on the database
